 # Kira Estrada Resumé
 
 It is a website to advertise the summary of skills, abilities and accomplishments that Kira Estrada has developed until now.
 
 ## UX
 
 ### Who is it for?
 
 This project is for potential recruiters, employers and customers.
 
 They are people who will be looking for information about Kira's experience and skills that could fit either their company or the project they would like to  get done.
 
 ### Structure and Design
 
 As part of the design of this project I used diferent frameworks/mockups to make the skeleton of the actual display of the website.
 
 This mockups are showing how the Resumé will look on different viewports:
 
 1. Desktop:  resumeDesktop.pdf
 2. Mobile Phone
 3. Tablet

All the design process was developed paying attention to the User Experience.  Making sure that the users' experience is as positive as posible, easy to follow and well structured.

To follow a clear structure I have created links which, when the user clicks on them, allows the user to open a new window where the user could view the information that it has been clicked.
